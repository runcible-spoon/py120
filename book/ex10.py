Don't let the mathiness of this problem scare you off. You don't have to know any math;
you only need to know how to write code.

Earlier, we wrote the following class:

class Vector:

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Vector):
            return NotImplemented

        new_x = self.x + other.x
        new_y = self.y + other.y
        return Vector(new_x, new_y)

    # __iadd__ method omitted; we don't need it for this exercise

    def __repr__(self):
        x = repr(self.x)
        y = repr(self.y)
        return f'Vector({x}, {y})'

v1 = Vector(5, 12)
v2 = Vector(13, -4)
print(v1 + v2)      # Vector(18, 8)

Update this class so the following code works as indicated:

In this code, the `*` operator should compute the *dot product* of the two vectors.
For instance, if you have `Vector(a, b)` and `Vector(c, d)`, the dot product is
`a * c + b * d`, where `*` and `+` are the usual arithmetic operators.

The `abs` function computes the magnitude of a vector. If you have a vector
`Vector(a, b)`, the magnitude is given by `sqrt(a**2 + b**2)`.
You will need the `math` module to access the `sqrt` function.

Note that `abs` is a built-in function, so you don't want to override it entirely;
you only want to change its behavior for `Vector` objects. There's a magic method you can use.

Don't worry about augmented assignment in this exercise.
